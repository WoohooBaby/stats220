# Intro about this repo

## Hello, this is my Assignments page for Stats 220 course as a starting point for getting familiar with R.👨‍🦽  
## This repo will be used by me to publish various assignment-related content for the convenience of lecturers to check📕



>I'm a **student** from *The University of Auckland*.  
>
>This is my first systematic learning of R and my whole understanding of R comes from suffering in other courses  
>
>You may not want to follow me as I ***may not*** post anything useful here :(
>>By the way, my benevolent 220 lecturer might come here to check my homework, so I may not post something funny here either💀

*So if you stumble upon my repo, please ignore me* 🙏
